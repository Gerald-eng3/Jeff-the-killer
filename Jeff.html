  <h1>Jeff the Killer</h1>
  <h2>A New Origin by Gerardo 🩸</h2>

  <div class="chapter">
    <h2>Part 1</h2>
    <p>In a new but evil neighborhood, a kind and adorable boy named Jeff and his brother Liu lived. They were happy of their new life. They didn't question the house as they loved its beauty.</p>
    <p>The father of the family, Peter, always took care of both Jeff and Liu. While the mother, Margaret, sometimes neglected Jeff. As she thought that Liu was more educated and just better. Jeff was always fueled of jealousy.</p>
    <p><strong>1st day:</strong> One day as he got scolded he ran off to his bedroom, he felt a stinging pain in his stomach. He dismissed it as lack of nutrition. He read books, trying to steer his mind of the worries and doubts of what it might have been.</p>
    <p><strong>2nd day:</strong> Jeff awoke and ran down the stairs with a large smile on his face. He sat down for breakfast, and suddenly his grin faded as the pain returned. This time, it was stronger... Jeff ignored it and both Liu and him went to fetch the bus.</p>
    <p>As they were sitting at the bus station, a kid with a skateboard jumped over them, slightly above their laps. Jeff shouted, "Hey! What was that for!?" The kid turned around and picked up his skateboard.</p>
    <p>The kid said, "Oh looks like we have some fresh meat." As he pronounced the last word, two more kids joined his sides. One was named Troy, he seemed fat. And the other was named Keith, he was the skinniest of them all (probably Mr. Stickman haha!).</p>
    <p>The kid in the middle, who stood there like a mad and tough guy. His name was Randy. He was a well-known gang leader in the neighborhood. Randy said with deep voice, "People that come across my ride, must pay a tax."</p>
    <p>Liu put up his fists, ready to knock all of them out. Suddenly, Keith pulled out a knife. Liu froze... his heart stopped. Meanwhile, Keith himself went to Liu and stole his wallet. Jeff felt the pain again, this time, it burnt him like a wild fire. Jeff came over to the confident kid and exclaimed, "Return his wallet or else!" Keith handed the wallet to Randy... And Randy replied, "I'm sorry that you couldn't listen, and what are you going to do about it?"</p>
    <p><em>*Jeff screamed in anger*</em>. He ran up to Randy and punched him in the nose, blood on his knuckles. He grabbed his wrist and twisted it like a rubber band. Randy was left traumatized on the pavement. The two other bullies tried to rush Jeff, but Jeff was too fast! He spun them around like ballerinas.</p>
    <p>Keith swung the knife at him. Jeff dodged easily. Keith gasped and looked at his arm as it was sliced by his own knife that Jeff snatched. Troy tried to grab Jeff but he wasn't too quick. Jeff spun and punched Troy in the stomach. Troy bled and puked on the pavement. All of the three were down, Liu watched in amazement.</p>
    <p>They both ran away from the bloodbath, they looked behind them, seeing that people were helping them...</p>

    <h2>Part 2</h2>
    <p>They were at school, Liu who started to admire Jeff for his brave actions thanked him. Jeff couldn't contain his excitement, his energy became dark and intriguing. Jeff wanted to hurt people, he wanted them to feel the same way as he did.</p>
    <p>Jeff returned home that evening. His parents asked about how his day went. Jeff exclaimed in a dark and joyful voice, "It was a wonderful day!"</p>
    <p><strong>Day 3:</strong> Jeff rose up to honks on the road. He quickly rushed downstairs. He saw two police officers, Margaret was at the door... He stopped dead in his tracks and thought, "No... did they get to know about it?" Margaret said angrily, "Jeff! I heard that there was a fight that you participated in! And I also heard that knives were included?!"</p>
    <p>Jeff replied back with worry, "Mother, they pulled the knives out first on me and Liu."</p>
    <p>A policeman intervened, "Boy, there are three kids in the hospital. They all had bruises and damage done to their body."</p>
    <p>Margaret asked Jeff to go grab Liu. But he couldn't. Jeff sighed, "It was me officers, I beat them up."</p>
    <p>As the policemen took out the handcuffs, Liu shouted, "Hey!" All of them looked up and gazed... He had a knife! Liu explained to them that it wasn't Jeff. Eventually shortly after, Liu was taken into the police car. Jeff cried and shouted for Liu to tell the truth. But silence came in return.</p>
    <p>Peter returned home, and saw the tears in Jeff's eyes. He asked, "Son what happened?" Jeff didn't reply at all. Margaret explained everything, both of his parents were now crying in disbelief. Jeff climbed back to his bedroom in pain. Two months passed by...</p>
    <p>Jeff was sleeping, until his mother turned on the lights. She said in an angry voice, "Get up! We have a party to go to."</p>
    <p>Jeff listened without hesitation. He wanted to lash out at his mother for being frustrated at him. But he couldn't, so they all got prepared. Jeff put on a simple and classic white hoodie and black pants. While his parents wore suits. Margaret was shocked and in disbelief to the lack of "disrespect" Jeff showed in his current personality. But she didn't complain and then they went for the party.</p>
    <p>There, they saw plenty of kids outside. And the neighbors invited and greeted each one of them. Peter did not quite enjoy the personality of his wife. They would usually fight at certain times. But in this party they wouldn't... Jeff went and played with the other kids outside. It was the first time he finally distanced his mind from Liu. Until he heard a familiar voice, a weird and echoing rolling noise. Then his brain reworked — Randy, Troy and Keith all jumped on the fence surrounding the house.</p>
    <p>They all had an evil intention. A plan ready to put at work. Randy said with madness in his eyes, "Well, well, well isn't this the old Jeff?" Jeff returned a phrase, "And aren't you supposed to be done with me?" Randy laughed, and exclaimed, "I would never be done with you!"</p>
    <p>After this, Randy charged at Jeff and tackled him to the ground. Kids were screaming and galloping around the yard. Parents didn't realize the kids fighting outside. Randy punched Jeff in the nose but Jeff would return the favour by headbutting Randy on his broken nose. Both were titans in their own world. In less than no time, the bullies who were watching pulled out guns, which they likely stole from a local gun-shop. That's when Jeff froze for the first time. Randy unleashed on him by kicking him. Then Troy slammed Jeff through the window. Jeff fell on a big radio, alerting all the parents inside.</p>
    <p>All of the bullies rushed inside. But the leader, Randy didn't wait for Jeff to get up. He kicked and stomped Jeff hard, until blood was seen pouring out of his mouth. The parents dialed the police and the ambulance knowing that there was going to be a massacre.</p>
    <p>Randy threw Jeff in the kitchen, he poured paint on him. Jeff was now white but still bleeding. He then threw him across the living room. Randy then said, "Get up! Jeff look at me!" Jeff glanced up... Randy exclaimed in a proud tone, "I was the one who sent your brother to jail, and hence you want to let him rot in there. You must feel shameful and fight me."</p>
    <p>Jeff got up, but he felt something, the feeling came back. This time it was pure determination and anger. Randy rushed at Jeff, and that's when it happened — Jeff snapped! His insanity was further destroyed and even eliminated from all table content of a human. He speared Randy! And then he punched him straight into the heart... Randy breathed his last breath and died.</p>
    <p>All the parents, shook and scared... couldn't do anything. Jeff ran up the stairs while bullets started unloading. He jumped into the bathroom crashing into big piles of small poles, likely from broken towel racks. He took one of them. The two remaining bullies climbed up the stairs, since their guns didn't have any bullets they brought knives instead. Troy swung at Jeff. But once again he dodged and smashed the pole into Troy's chin, knocking him out cold.</p>
    <p>Keith came back, but this time more agile. He dodged Jeff's attack and pushed him into a stack of bottles. A bottle of bleach poured over them. They were in pain, eyes burning. Jeff swung the pole straight into his mouth. Keith fell, mouth bleeding. He smiled mischievously... Jeff asked, "Why are you smiling, weirdo?" Keith answered, "You are covered in bleach and paint which is likely filled with methanol, stupido." Keith threw a lighter at him...</p>
    <p>Jeff was burning, it was a total disaster. Jeff ran outside and fell down the stairs, everyone was pale as ghosts. Jeff fainted, as he saw his parents putting the fire out and heard sirens outside the house.</p>

    <h2>Part 3 (Final)</h2>
    <p>Jeff woke up in the hospital. Bandages covered his face, he didn't know what were his surroundings. He heard a familiar voice, it was his careless mother — it was the first time she sounded so worried.</p>
    <p>She said in a sad voice, "Oh my baby! I am so sorry for what I have put you through. I have some good news, Liu got out of jail. All eye witnesses proved that Randy was the attacker."</p>
    <p>Jeff almost bolted up but was stopped by Margaret. She came closer and hugged Jeff tightly. After some days, they continued to visit him. Bringing him food and stuff. Until the day his bandages were to be removed. As a doctor was removing the bandages from his face, everyone was on the edge of their seats.</p>
    <p>He took off the final straw, letting the rest fall off. Jeff's family froze at the sight of his face. Even Liu was there, scared but still caring... Jeff wondered about his face and he bolted to the bathroom, he looked at the mirror. His face changed... his skin was so white that it resembled as if he was deeply covered with makeup. His lips were burnt to a darker and sinister red. His hair was nearly removed but there were still some strands left... It changed color, before it was brown, now it is dark.</p>
    <p>Liu said in a motivating phrase, "Jeff you are still my brother, it doesn't look that bad." Jeff replied, "Bad? It looks perfect!" He started laughing uncontrollably... His hands were twitching. Jeff sounded so much happier for his new appearance, all of this was caused by his lack of insanity.</p>
    <p>His family was stunned. Margaret asked the doctor, "Umm... Sir, is my son okay like in the head?" The doctor answered back, "It is practically okay, since patients often react like this when they are on big painkillers. If his behavior doesn't change at all come back within a week." Margaret replied, "Okay thank you doctor..." The doctor added a sentence, "Don't leave him alone..."</p>
    <p>They returned home, with respect and recognition for their son. Jeff went into his bedroom...</p>
    <p>Some hours passed by, later in the night. Margaret heard scary cries in the bathroom. She went to check it out. She turned on the lights and peeked into the bathroom. She gasped in terror! Jeff was cutting a smile with a knife across his cheeks! She asked with tears in her eyes, "J-Jeff what are you doing?" Jeff answered, "Mother, my cheeks hurt too much, now I can smile forever." Margaret looked at his eyes, they were ringed in black and wide. It was as if he wasn't blinking at all. She asked another question, "Jeff w-what happened to your eyes?" Jeff replied, "Mom, I was staring at my face, my eyes were getting tired, so I burnt my eyelids. Now I can see my face forever!"</p>
    <p>Margaret backed away slowly... Jeff added, "Don't you think I am beautiful?" Margaret replied scared, "Y-yes you are really beautiful my son. Let me go get Peter so he can see you..." She ran off to the bedroom and shook her husband. She saw Jeff in the hallway, with a knife... Jeff screeched, "You lied!!" That was the final straw, Jeff unloaded his hatred and gutted both of his parents. Liu who woke up from thundering footsteps straightened... but he thought nothing of it and went to sleep again.</p>
    <p>But as he was driving off, Jeff covered his mouth. Liu tried to scream, but only tiny murmurs escaped. He tried to escape, but the only thing he was able to do was to move his head. Jeff plunged the knife into Liu as he whispered, "Shhhhhh... Go to sleep...." All the fighting alerted the neighbors. The police came and found no one but dead bodies and blood.</p>
